    <link href="http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2015/08/19/gsoc-2015-nmatrix/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-19T09:57:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2015/08/19/gsoc-2015-nmatrix</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My Google Summer of Code project was working on the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix">NMatrix project</a>, moving
functionality that depends on external libraries from the core <code>nmatrix</code>
gem to optional plugin gems. NMatrix is a Ruby library for linear algebra,
used by many other projects.
In addition to the code that was part of
NMatrix proper, NMatrix previously required the <a href="http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/">ATLAS library</a>, which
implemented fast versions of common matrix operations like multiplication
and inversion, as well as more advanced operations like eigenvalue
decomposition and Cholesky decomposition.</p>

<p>There were two separate but related motivations for my project. The
first was to simplify the NMatrix installation
process. ATLAS can be difficult to install, so the installation
process for NMatrix was complicated, especially on
OS X, and may have discouraged people from using NMatrix.
The second motivation was that by separating out the ATLAS code from the
main NMatrix code, it would be easier to add new linear algebra backends
which provide similar features. Indeed, I implemented a second backend this
summer.</p>

<p>The end result of my summer's work:</p>

<ul>
<li>The core <code>nmatrix</code> gem does not depend on any external linear matrix
libraries. It provides non-optimized implementations of common matrix
operations.</li>
<li>All code that requires ATLAS has been moved into the new <code>nmatrix-atlas</code>
gem, so that
those who are only interested in the core functionality are not required to
install ATLAS. <code>nmatrix-atlas</code> provides optimized implementations of common matrix
operations, as well as advanced functions not available in <code>nmatrix</code>.
I wrote a blog post describing the setup for <a href="http://wlevine.github.io/2015/06/15/releasing-multiple-gems-with-c-extensions-from-the-same-repository.html">releasing multiple gems from the same repository</a>, which this required.</li>
<li>A new gem <code>nmatrix-lapacke</code>, which provides the same features as
<code>nmatrix-atlas</code>, but instead of depending specifically on the ATLAS
library, requires any generic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAPACK">LAPACK</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_Linear_Algebra_Subprograms">BLAS</a>
implementation. This should be easier to use for many users as they may
already have LAPACK installed (it comes pre-installed with OS X and is
commonly used in Linux systems), but not ATLAS.</li>
<li>The installation procedure is simplified, especially for those installing
just the <code>nmatrix</code> gem. Compare the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation">new installation instructions</a>
to the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Installation/2ac41c62d35c79468d3d8169be0ccba238c3c921">old ones</a>.</li>
</ul>


<p>The one deviation from my original proposal was that I originally intended to remove
all the ATLAS code and release only the <code>nmatrix-lapacke</code> plugin, so that we
would only have one interface to the advanced linear algebra functions, but I
decided to keep the ATLAS code, since the <code>nmatrix-lapacke</code> code is new and
has not had a chance to be thoroughly tested.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>```ruby
require 'nmatrix'</p>

<h1>create a 3-by-3 matrix</h1>

<p>a = NMatrix.new([3,3], [1,2,3, 4,5,6, 7,8,9], dtype: :float64)</p>

<h1>invert it using non-optimized NMatrix-internal implementation</h1>

<p>a.invert!
```</p>

<p>```ruby
require 'nmatrix'
require 'nmatrix/atlas' #or require 'nmatrix/lapacke'</p>

<h1>create a 3-by-3 matrix</h1>

<p>a = NMatrix.new([3,3], [1,2,3, 4,5,6, 7,8,9], dtype: :float64)</p>

<h1>invert it using optimized implementation provided by ATLAS</h1>

<p>a.invert!
```</p>

<p>For advanced functions not provided by the core <code>nmatrix</code> gem, for example
<a href="http://sciruby.com/nmatrix/docs/NMatrix.html#method-i-gesvd"><code>gesvd</code></a>, <code>nmatrix-atlas</code> and <code>nmatrix-lapacke</code>
provide a common interface:</p>

<p><code>ruby
require 'nmatrix'
require 'nmatrix/atlas'
a = NMatrix.new([4,5],[1,0,0,0,2, 0,0,3,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0,4,0,0,0],
dtype: dtype)
u, s, vt = a.gesvd
</code></p>

<p>```ruby</p>

<h1>Identical to the above, except for the require</h1>

<p>require 'nmatrix'
require 'nmatrix/lapacke'
a = NMatrix.new([4,5],[1,0,0,0,2, 0,0,3,0,0, 0,0,0,0,0, 0,4,0,0,0],
dtype: dtype)
u, s, vt = a.gesvd
```</p>

<p>If the developer wants to use an advanced feature, but does not care
whether the user is using <code>nmatrix-atlas</code>
or <code>nmatrix-lapacke</code>, they can <code>require nmatrix/lapack_plugin</code>, which will
require whichever of the two is available, instead of being forced to
choose between the two.</p>

<p>As a fun test of the new gems, I did a very simple benchmark, just
testing how long it took to invert a
1500-by-1500 matrix in place using <code>NMatix#invert!</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>nmatrix</code> (no external libraries): 3.67s</li>
<li><code>nmatrix-atlas</code>: 0.96s</li>
<li><code>nmatrix-lapacke</code> with ATLAS: 0.99s</li>
<li><code>nmatrix-lapacke</code> with OpenBLAS (multithreading enabled): 0.39s</li>
<li><code>nmatrix-lapacke</code> with reference implementations of LAPACK and BLAS: 3.72s</li>
</ul>


<p>This is not supposed to be a thorough or realistic benchmark (performance will
depend on your system, on how you built the libraries, and on the exact
functions that you use), but there
are still a few interesting conclusions we can draw from it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Performance is much better using the two highly optimized libraries
(ATLAS and OpenBLAS) than using either the NMatrix
internal implementation or the reference implementation.</li>
<li>When using ATLAS, performance is similar whether using <code>nmatrix-atlas</code>
and <code>nmatrix-lapacke</code> (this means we could consider deprecating
the <code>nmatix-atlas</code> gem).</li>
</ul>


<p>Overall, my summer has been productive. I implemented everything that I
proposed and feedback from testers so far has been positive.
I plan to stay involved with NMatrix, especially to follow up on any issues
related to my changes.
Although I won't be a student next summer, I would certainly consider
participating in Google Summer of Code in the future as a mentor.
I'd like to
thank my mentor John Woods and the rest of the SciRuby community for support
and feedback throughout the summer.</p>

    <link href="http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2015/02/14/nmatrix-beta-released-belated-announcement/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-14T14:56:00-06:00</updated>
    <id>http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2015/02/14/nmatrix-beta-released-belated-announcement</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Almost two months ago, in December, we <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/nmatrix">release our first beta of NMatrix</a>, our
linear algebra library for the Ruby language.</p>

<p>Rather than discussing what NMatrix has (which you can find in the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/blob/master/README.rdoc">readme</a>),
I want to take this opportunity to discuss where we'd like it to go in the future. Think of this as our roadmap to 1.0.</p>

<h2>External Library Requirements</h2>

<p>NMatrix currently has an extremely limited set of Ruby gem dependencies &mdash; essentially only packable, which is
needed for some of the I/O functionality &mdash; but as with other linear algebra libraries, its native library
requirements can be problematic.</p>

<p>Specifically, NMatrix requires ATLAS &mdash; which is virtually impossible to install on many Macs, and is no longer
readily available with Yosemite &mdash; and also likes to have LAPACK around. Moreover, some would prefer to use other
math libraries with NMatrix.</p>

<p>There are several partial solutions. The clearest is that any components of NMatrix which require external non-standard
libraries need to be abstracted into separate gems &mdash; such as <tt>nmatrix-atlas</tt> and <tt>nmatrix-io</tt> &mdash; and
that these components should be interchangeable with others. NMatrix then needs to be able to fall back on either native
C/C++ or Ruby implementations of certain functionalities.</p>

<p>To this end, a number of simple LAPACK and CBLAS functions have been implemented in NMatrix, with volunteers working on
a few others (the list is available in the README). <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015-Ideas#abstraction-of-atlascblasclapack-or-openblas-into-a-separate-gem">One of our proposed Google Summer of Code 2015 project ideas</a> involves
breaking up NMatrix into several gems.</p>

<p>The end result will be a much simpler installation process, and more freedom of choice.</p>

<h2>Removal of Unnecessary Features</h2>

<p>We thought it would be quite clever to include rational number support in NMatrix, including three types (32-bit, 64-bit,
and 128-bit). Unfortunately, these types increase compilation time by about 30% (back-of-the-envelope calculation), and
aren't particularly useful since most matrix operations with rationals as inputs give irrational-valued matrices
as their outputs. The inclusion of rational types also complicates the codebase.</p>

<p>Additionally, rationals are computationally problematic; what happens if there is overflow? Ruby handles overflow gracefully
in its own rational type, which NMatrix users would still be able to utilize via the <tt>:object</tt> dtype.</p>

<h2>You</h2>

<p>The biggest change going forward is that NMatrix development needs to support actual use-cases. In the past, we've aimed
to flesh out support for sparse storage formats, as well as math operations for the dense storage-type. It is folly to
develop features no one wants to use. Future core development, then, will aim to make NMatrix's current feature set more
usable.</p>

<p>That means that future non-core development depends on you. What would you like to see in NMatrix? What would make it
more useful for you?</p>

<p>If you want to become involved, now is a good time. We're getting ready to submit a Google Summer of Code application
(our third, I believe), and we're in need of students &mdash; <em>and especially mentors</em>. Please consider joining
our <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sciruby-dev">mailing list</a> and adding yourself as a mentor on the
<a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/sciruby/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-2015-Ideas">ideas page</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks so much for your support!</p>

    <link href="http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2014/06/04/introducing-the-fftw-sciruby-gsoc-project/"/>
    <updated>2014-06-04T12:30:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2014/06/04/introducing-the-fftw-sciruby-gsoc-project</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My name is Magdalen Berns and I am a physics student with a technical
background in live audio. I am particularly interested in using science
and technology to improve access for all.</p>

<p>This summer, I will be working on implementing the external library
appropriately named "Fastest Fourier Transform in the West" version 3
(FFTW3) C and Fortran API in Ruby for this year's Google Summer of Code
(GSoC).</p>

<p>The primary aim of the project is to give SciRuby the capability to
handle signal analysis, processing and synthesis by performing discrete
fast Fourier transform operations on NMatrix objects.</p>

<p>After some investigation during the preparation stages of GSoC, it was
determined that implementing FFTW3 is more desirable than starting from
scratch in pure Ruby because the FFTW3 API is already extensively used,
developed, and optimised far beyond what would be achievable in just
three months. So, putting FFTW3 in the driving seat allows the SciRuby
project to take advantage of the good work of the FFTW3 developers by
bringing it to Ruby.</p>

<p>Putting NMatrix to the test with FFTW3 should give users the
opportunity to test drive NMatrix &mdash; and SciRuby's NMatrix developers a
chance to root out bugs.</p>

<p>Since a gem called ruby-fftw3 already existed to perform FFTW3 operations
on NArray objects, I forked that repository as a starting point. <a href="https://github.com/thisMagpie/fftw">Things are progressing on my Github fork</a> right now.</p>

<p>My mentor for this project is Colin Fuller who is an exceptionally
talented programmer &mdash; and he really knows his git too. He has been a
great help as I adapt to the learning curve of working in C and
Ruby (languages which I am less familiar with than say, Java or
JavaScript).</p>

<p>As I work, I intend to share useful gems of information I gather. Those, in addition to my weekly project updates, will appear right here in this blog so others can hopefully benefit.</p>

<p>I have already posted a few useful bits and bobs on
<a href="http://thismagpie.com">thismagpie.com</a> which relate to my work so far.
I hope to add those to the SciRuby blog, too, provided
the readers are interested in that and time permits. Of course, readers here can feel free to have a browse
of the keywords <a href="http://thismagpie.com/keyword/sciruby">sciruby</a>,
<a href="http://thismagpie.com/keyword/ruby">ruby</a> and
<a href="http://thismagpie.com/keyword/git">git</a> on there for the time being.
I sometimes add posts, manuals and tutorials from external sites where I
find useful ones on the web too, so watch out for these too.</p>

<p>Please, feel free to watch or follow along as the project comes together
and those inclined are welcome to share constructive comments and advice
or raise bugs on the fftw3 issue tracker. Input about my work is very
welcome as the project progresses. This gem is being written for the
community, after all!</p>

    <link href="http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release/"/>
    <updated>2013-09-18T15:18:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2013/09/18/nmatrix-nearing-beta-release</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As of this writing, NMatrix v0.0.9 is available on RubyGems. It is likely that the next version will be a beta release
candidate, as there's only one critical feature still missing (<code>==</code> between matrices of different storage types).</p>

<p>An enormous amount has changed since my last entry.</p>

<h2>New, friendlier constructor</h2>

<p>First and foremost, NMatrix sports a new constructor, based
on <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/sciruby-dev/tPwnmPbRR_U/PL0Nc92gdzEJ">helpful comments from folks on the listserv</a>. Here
are some examples of construction:</p>

<pre><code>NMatrix.new([4,4], 0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :int32, all 0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0) # 4x4 dense matrix of :float64, all 0.0
NMatrix.new([4,4], 0.0, dtype: :complex64) # 4x4 dense matrix of :complex64
NMatrix.new([1,4], stype: :yale) # size 4 sparse (Yale) row vector of 0s
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2]) # 4 rows, 3 columns: gradient across each row from 0 to 2 (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,3], [0,1,2], stype: :yale, default: 0) # same as above, but Yale storage (int32)
NMatrix.new([4,1], stype: :list, dtype: :rational128) # size 4 sparse (list) column vector of rational 0s
NMatrix.new([4,4]) # 4x4 dense matrix containing nils
NMatrix.new([4,4], dtype: :int64) # 4x4 uninitialized dense matrix containing 64-bit integers
NMatrix.new(4)     # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>The different storage types (stypes) have slightly different behaviors when no initialization value is provided. This
may change in the future, but addresses the somewhat different use-cases of these storage types.</p>

<p>I show a variety of examples above, several of which are not particularly wise uses --- for example, the <code>[0,1,2]</code> Yale
gradient, which uses 32-bit integers and must store 11 column indices and pointers (which are most likely unsigned
long integers) in addition to the 11 entries (4 for the always-stored diagonal, 1 for the default, and 6 for the
non-diagonal non-zeros).</p>

<p>The key to understanding the differing construction is the default value. All sparse matrices need a default. Usually we
think of sparse matrices as being zero-based (only non-zero values are stored), but NMatrix now allows other defaults.
However, dense matrices don't need defaults, and in fact sometimes it's more efficient to allocate them without
initializing them --- such as if they're about to store the results of some LAPACK function call. But if they contain
Ruby objects, they <strong>have</strong> to be initialized, which is why they become nil.</p>

<p>We're still working out a few bugs in construction. If you find any, please report them in our <a href="http://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues">issue tracker</a>.</p>

<h2>Elimination of NVectors</h2>

<p>We removed the NVector class. Frankly, it didn't make sense. A vector can't have an orientation unless it has multiple
dimensions --- even if some of those dimensions have length 1. Now, vectors and matrices are treated the same in the code.</p>

<p>The good news is that element access (<code>[]</code>) has been rewritten so that the programmer only needs provide the coordinates
whose dimensions are not 1. For example:</p>

<pre><code>n = NMatrix.new([4,1,3], 0) # 3-dimensional matrix of 0s
n[2,1] == n[2,0,1]
=&gt; true
</code></pre>

<p>The same rule applies to slicing.</p>

<h2>Slicing improvements</h2>

<p>Aleksey Timin contributed the framework for matrix slicing. Matrices can be sliced by copying or by reference. Modifying
a copy-slice does not modify the original matrix; but modifying a reference slice does.</p>

<p>A copy of some portion of the matrix may be made using <code>NMatrix#slice</code>:</p>

<pre><code>new_matrix = n.slice(0..1,0..2)
</code></pre>

<p>And what appears to be a copy, but is actually a reference, may be made using brackets:</p>

<pre><code>ref = n[0..1,0..2]
</code></pre>

<p>Reference slices may also be modified in a variety of ways:</p>

<pre><code>n[0..4,2..8] = 0   # change all entries to 0
n[0..4,2..8] = [0,1,2]  # change the selected entries to [0,1,2,0,1,2,0,1,2...]
n[0..4,2..8] = NMatrix.new([3,3], [0,1,2]) # same as above
</code></pre>

<p>For the sake of speed, each of these <code>[]=</code> returns the right-hand value, whether that value is an array, matrix, or
single value. So, you can do this:</p>

<pre><code>x = m[0..4,2..8] = n[0..1,0..2] = [1,2,3]
</code></pre>

<p>and <code>x</code> will be equal to <code>[1,2,3]</code> after the evaluation.</p>

<h2>Iteration</h2>

<p>Matrices are now enumerable. There are a variety of enumerators --- namely <code>each_with_indices</code> (and <code>each</code>), <code>each_stored_with_indices</code>,
and <code>each_ordered_stored_with_indices</code>. The first, <code>each</code>, is guaranteed to produce the same iteration regardless of the
storage type. The other two iterate only across the stored entries.</p>

<h2>Elementwise comparisons</h2>

<p>A regular matrix comparison, returning a single boolean, can be accomplished using <code>==</code> or <code>!=</code>. In earlier versions of
NMatrix, the results of the element-wise versions, <code>=~</code>, <code>!~</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, and <code>&lt;=</code>, were matrices of 0s and 1s,
stored using the <code>:byte</code> dtype.</p>

<p>Now, these comparisons return matrices of Ruby objects:</p>

<pre><code>n &lt; m
=&gt; [ true,  false, false, true,
     false, false, false, true,
     true,  true,  true,  true  ]
</code></pre>

<p>Try experimenting with sparse matrices to see how the default value (<code>#default_value</code>) is initialized on the result during an
elementwise comparison.</p>

<h2>Chunky bacon</h2>

<p>I'm really excited about all of the chunky bacon in our latest release. I feel like things are really coming together
for our library. I'm also glad to see that people are using it.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of using NMatrix yourself, I strongly encourage it. Although I'm writing my dissertation, I plan to
prioritize troubleshooting ahead of just about everything else. I want using NMatrix to be an easy choice for every
Rubyist.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading!</p>

    <id>http://SciRuby.github.com/blog/2012/12/07/how-to-use-nmatrix-shortcuts</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p class="warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> This code predates v0.0.9 alpha, which is when the NMatrix constructor changed. Please check the <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/Getting-started#shortcuts">NMatrix Getting Started guide</a> for the most recent information.</p>


<p>John Woods <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/commit/2b480ce0985affc7218fc341fcb4e5024b30545b">merged my last pull request to NMatrix</a> recently and I wanted to write about why we created these shortcuts and what can be done with them. <!--more--></p>

<h2>The need for shortcuts</h2>

<p>The first iteration of NMatrix shortcuts was written by <a href="https://github.com/dcarrera">Daniel Carrera</a> and sent to the mailing list, where I started working with them. Some discussions, decisions and two pull requests later, we have a working set of methods to create common matrices (<code>zeros</code>, <code>ones</code>, <code>random</code>, etc) and do some cool stuff (<code>column</code> and <code>linspace</code>) very easily.</p>

<p>There are at least two good reasons to have these shortcuts: MATLAB users are going to feel at home, and the shortcuts allow us to prototype and experiment more rapidly. For example, it's dead simple to create an identify matrix when you need one:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; require 'nmatrix'

&gt;&gt; matrix = NMatrix.identity(3) # 3x3
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b8cda40shape:[3,3] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt; 
&gt;&gt; matrix.pp

# [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 1.0, 0.0]
# [0.0, 0.0, 1.0]
</code></pre>

<p>And a random matrix to test some operation:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; rand_matrix = NMatrix.random(4) # 4x4
=&gt; #&lt;NMatrix:0x007faa5b01cdd8shape:[4,4] dtype:float64 stype:dense&gt;
&gt;&gt; rand_matrix.pp

</code></pre>

<h2>Shortcuts available</h2>

<p>The following list is taken from <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/wiki/NMatrix">NMatrix's wiki</a>. All are class methods on <code>NMatrix</code>.</p>

<pre><code>ones(3,3)                    # A 3x3 matrix of ones.
zeros(4,4) or zeroes(4,4)    # Creates a matrix of zeros with dimensions as parameters.
identity(5,5) or eye(5,5)    # A 5x5 identity matrix. Only works with NMatrix.
seq(8)                       # An 8-vector with a sequence of values from 0 to 7.
random(6,6)                  # A 6x6 matrix of random values between 0 and 1.

column(2)                    # Return the 2nd column of the original matrix. Only works with NMatrix.

<p>The method names are mostly from MATLAB. In the future, when more functionality is added, we'll try to create a more "Ruby-like" feel to the API. But as these shortcuts do very primitive tasks, there isn't any obvious room for improvement. (Feel free to prove us wrong, however!)</p>

<p>I'll create a separate wiki page for the shortcuts to be able to organize and put more information about how to use them. But I want to create a better RDoc documentation for NMatrix — so the full API will probably be referenced there. I'll write a new blog post here when something along these lines is done.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<p>First, let's try normalizing the columns of an NMatrix.</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

m = NMatrix.seq(3, :float32)
m.pp

# [0.0, 1.0, 2.0]
# [3.0, 4.0, 5.0]
# [6.0, 7.0, 8.0]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
    norm = Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0, 0])
    (0 .. m.shape[0] - 1).each { |i| m[i,j] /= norm }
end

m.pp

# [0.0, 0.12309148907661438, 0.20739033818244934]
# [0.4472135901451111, 0.4923659563064575, 0.5184758305549622]
# [0.8944271802902222, 0.861640453338623, 0.8295613527297974]

(0 .. m.shape[1] - 1).each do |j|
  col = m.column(j)
  puts Math.sqrt(col.transpose.dot(col)[0,0])
end

# 0.9999999701976772
# 1.0
# 1.0
</code></pre>

<p>Unfortunately, slice by reference isn't working on <code>HEAD</code>, or we could make a few additional improvements (see issue <a href="https://github.com/SciRuby/nmatrix/issues/51">#51</a>).</p>

<p>The other thing that I've wanted to do is to use <code>linspace</code> to generate points for plotting sines, cosines, etc. Here is an example:</p>

<pre><code>require 'nmatrix'

vector = NVector.linspace(0, Math::PI, 10)
vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3490658503988659
# 0.6981317007977318
# 1.0471975511965976
# 1.3962634015954636
# 1.7453292519943295
# 2.0943951023931953
# 2.443460952792061
# 2.792526803190927
# 3.141592653589793

10.times do |i|
  vector[k, 0] = Math::sin(vector[k, 0])
end

vector.pretty_print

# 0.0
# 0.3420201433256687
# 0.6427876096865393
# 0.8660254037844386
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.984807753012208
# 0.8660254037844388
# 0.6427876096865395
# 0.3420201433256689
# 1.2246467991473532e-16

<p>These results show a happy result, in that we are able to use NMatrix for simple tasks already. Of course, there are problems to be solved, e.g. slice by reference, inversion for all dtypes, eigenvalues. But it's going somewhere, it's growing.</p>

<p>I hope that by this time next year we'll have a very mature linear algebra library (and much more).</p>
